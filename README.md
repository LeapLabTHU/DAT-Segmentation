# Vision Transformer with Deformable Attention

This repository contains the code of semantic segmentation for the paper Vision Transformer with Deformable Attention \[[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00520)\], and DAT++: Spatially Dynamic Vision Transformerwith Deformable Attention (extended version)\[[OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/b/s!ApI0vb6wPqmtgrl6Pqn0wybDrpaxvg?e=4yVs7Z)]. 

This code is based on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [Swin Segmentation](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Swin-Transformer-Semantic-Segmentation). To get started, you can follow the instructions in [Swin Transformer](https://github.com/SwinTransformer/Swin-Transformer-Semantic-Segmentation/blob/main/README.md).
